# A new, more efficient list structure
<hr>
SnakeList is a new list that features a slightly different way of adding and removing elements.
The idea is that the beginning of the list can be at any index of the array and can loop around the ends.
This reduces the time for adding and removing to the beginning by around half as much.

SnakeList was created in Java to demo its functionality and performance.

In the future the SnakeList should be compared to the regular java list,
and a recreation of the java list for control with benchmark testing.
A custom java list should be made in order to test any extra efficiencies
that the built-in java list may have.

The idea is that this list is only a demo comparison to the standard list. 
Therefore the SnakeList would in theory be able to get similar efficiencies 
that the built-in java list has once it is actually implemented.
